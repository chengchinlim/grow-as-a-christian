Hi, nice to meet you! I am the main contributor to the website.

I learned a lot from brothers and sisters in Christ in weekly fellowships. I believe that if I construct those learnings in words, I could understand even more and apply the values in my daily life.

I hope my learnings could remind my fellow readers that Christ is good and we always have room to grow in Him.

If you have any comments about the content or the website, do not hesitate to shoot me an email. I will reply as soon as I can.
