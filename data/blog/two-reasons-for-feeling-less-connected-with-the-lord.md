A testimony shared by a church sister last Saturday touched me. When she was sharing, tears rolled down her cheeks because she suddenly realized that she loved her first-born son (a one-year-old plus infant) and worldly things more than the Lord.

###### **We all made the same mistakes, and we did not realize it.**

But, putting myself in the church sister's shoes, I would say it is impossible not to love your son more than anything else in the world, including the Lord.

From her testimony, I learned the two main reasons we feel less connected with the Lord.

###### **One, we lost the first love towards Him.**<br /><br />

###### **Two, we forgot His first love for us.**

When we received the Lord Jesus as our Savior, we felt satisfied and thanked Him for what He has done in our lives. However, as time passes, we are occupied physically and mentally by our hectic schedules when carrying on with our lives.

Married couples are the best illustration example in this case. They lost their first love for each other and feel less connected when prioritizing other things over their marriage.

###### **We are the believers of Jesus Christ because He loved us first.**

From all the lost sheep, He found us so that we can follow Him. But how often do we forget His first love when we feel less connected to Him?

One man is walking alone in the desert. At night, he felt hopeless because it was still a long way to get past the desert. But, looking back at his path, he felt very lonely when he saw his footprints.

A few days later, he was excited as he saw trees and rivers in front of him. Then, looking back at his footprints, he suddenly realized the prints were without shoes. He remembered he was wearing his boots. So why were the footmarks without shoes?

###### **Jesus Christ carried him on His back, and those footprints are His.**

He felt so relieved and grateful that he was not alone by himself. The Lord had always been there with him.

###### **When you look backward and see only one set of footprints, look closer, they might not be yours.**
