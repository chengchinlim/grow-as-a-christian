**“You are clean, even now, through the teaching which I have given you. Be in me at all times as I am in you. As the branch is not able to give fruit of itself, if it is not still on the vine, so you are not able to do so if you are not in me.” （John 15:3-4)**

As the above verses mention, the Lord could be in us if we open our hearts to Him. In this way, we could be closely connected to Him spiritually.

My previous article explains the [two reasons we feel disconnected from the Lord](https://www.growasachristian.com/blog/two-reasons-for-feeling-less-connected-with-the-lord). What are the reasons to connect to the Lord? I will answer this question in my future articles.

The main focus of this article is to learn the three practical ways to open our hearts to the Lord.

**One. Sing hymns or worship songs.**

King David is the best example when it comes to praising the Lord through music. He went through a lot of hardships in his life but he never forgot to worship Him. David loved to play his lyre (many people thought it was a harp) and sang to praise the Lord.

**“O make a new song to the Lord; let all the earth make melody to the Lord. Make songs to the Lord, blessing his name; give the good news of his salvation day by day.” (Psalms 96:1-2)**

You might wonder what are the differences between hymns and worship songs? In my opinion,
hymns focus more on the lyrics and have easy melodies to follow. On the other hand, worship songs focus more on the components of the music to suit different cultures and audiences.

From my experience, most songs we sing in churches from hymnals are hymns and the songs from Christian radio stations are worship songs. Some churches prefer to sing from the hymnals only because they are sure that the lyrics are curated and the truth of the Bible is portrayed. In the meantime, some churches use worship songs on YouTube to praise the Lord.

**I believe that singing both hymns and worship songs will open up our hearts to the Lord.** When we sing, we indirectly express ourselves through our voice and it helps us to feel His love and mercy.

If I have to choose one out of the two, I prefer singing hymns because I enjoy the simplicity of those songs and my mind can solely focus on the lyrics, which many times come from the Bible verses. The melodies of some contemporary worship songs divert my focus from the lyrics to the melodies. However, we should sing whatever Christian songs that open our hearts to the Lord.

**Two. Read the Word.**

Looks easy. But before even start reading, we need to quiet down our hearts and be spiritually prepared. How many times have we had tight schedules, read the Word rapidly, and felt good about ourselves?

Are we ready to open our hearts when we are reading His Word? Or do we treat His Word like an encyclopedia or an interesting fiction book?

If you feel similar to reading this article like you read the Word, you need to stop immediately and think again. In my previous article, I explained [how I read the Bible the wrong way](https://www.growasachristian.com/blog/i-had-been-reading-his-word-the-wrong-way). You should definitely check it out to prevent the same mistakes I made.

We should be prepared to let the Lord talk to us through his Word. Even though we might have read the chapters before, many times we have different feelings towards them because our values change over time.

The Word is a communication channel between our spirits and the Lord. Through the Word, we could understand His grace and mercy so we have hope in life. Opening up our hearts means that we allow our spirit connects with the Lord’s Spirit.

**Three. Pray and call upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.**

In the above paragraphs, I mentioned singing expresses ourselves through voice. In prayers, we express our emotions through our souls and spirits.

The book of Psalms is the best illustration of the prayers’ importance. I referred to King David in the first few paragraphs. But I need to refer to him again because as far as I know, he is the biblical character who is super good at opening his heart to the Lord.

Many times we prayed like we were reading a script because we were not prepared to be open to Him. In the book of Psalms, we could see how passionate David was when he prayed to the Lord.

When I read through Psalms chapter by chapter, David prayed very frequently because he had a close relationship with the Lord. He knew that praying is the best way to communicate to the Lord, either to praise Him or to voice out complaints to Him. King David should be our role model, and if we are uncertain about how to pray, we could always refer to the book of Psalms and start from there.

In summary, the 3 ways to open our hearts to the Lord are:

One. Sing hymns or worship songs.

Two. Read the Word.

Three. Pray and call upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.

**Do you practice them regularly?**
