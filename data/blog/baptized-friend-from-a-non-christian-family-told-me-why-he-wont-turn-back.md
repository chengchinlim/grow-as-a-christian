My friend got baptized two years ago. We were sitting in the car driving to get some Chinese food. I was curious and asked him why he chose to be faithful to the Lord (his past two years have been tough).

Thinking about why I am faithful to the Lord, I know it is easy to believe in Him because I grew up in a Christian family. I genuinely believe the Lord Jesus Christ is my savior.

**But my friend will give a better perspective since he is the only believer in his family.**

After a lengthy chat, I found the two main reasons for keeping my friend faithful to the Lord.

**One. Fear of darkness.**

Our hearts are like houses with curtains. When we neglect the Lord, we do not unfold the curtains. Sunlight cannot shine through. They are dark and unpleasant to stay in for a long time.

**The Lord is like a lamp; He shines through our hearts, and we have inner peace through Him.**

Darkness makes us feel like we are alone. Knowing to let our Lord into our hearts makes us feel hopeful about our life. Know that He is there for us in hardships.

“Come to me, all you who are troubled and weighted down with care, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke on you and become like me, for I am gentle and without pride, and you will have rest for your souls; For my yoke is good, and the weight I take up is not hard.” (Matthews 11:28-30)

The above verses are what Jesus said when He preached to the crowd. **Jesus knows that there are always burdens in life; He wants us to let Him carry our burdens.**

**Two. Purpose of life.**

“All is to no purpose, said the Preacher, all the ways of man are to no purpose. What is a man profited by all his work which he does under the sun? One generation goes and another comes; but the earth is for ever.” (Ecclesiastes 1:2-4)

The above verses are written by King Solomon of Israel when he realized that human hearts will never be fulfilled by any earthly things. **God created us, and He is the only one that could fulfill our souls.**

What is the purpose of life? Many people from different religious and cultural backgrounds have other answers. The answer to this question from a biblical perspective is for another article.

My friend was touched by how the Lord saved him. It was like a shepherd found a lost sheep. He realized the Lord loved him before he knew how to love others.

**Because the Lord Jesus Christ first loved us, we have the opportunity to love one another.** With this mindset, we can be excited every day when we can make the world a better place just by a tiny bit.

The positive vibe comes from the inside out when we have a purpose in life. Smiling to a stranger or doing sweet things to our friends and families is one example of spreading positive to our surroundings.

I am very joyful for my friend because he trusts the Lord fully. Wish him the best to continue his spiritual journey with the Lord.

**When our Christian life is wilting, do not turn back; the Lord always leads you on the best path.**
