Starting my sophomore year in college, I had always attended Bible studies and fellowships weekly because I was passionate about His Word.

However, sometimes I was lost because I did not know what to study next.

So I voiced my concerns to a church brother, and after a lengthy discussion, he pointed out a critical fact that I had been neglecting this whole time.

###### **We should read His Word with the mentality that we connect with the Lord spiritually, not theological concepts or knowledge.**

Many of us do not seek the connection with the Lord spiritually when we are reading the Bible.

Instead, we treat His Word as historical events or thoughtful advice. But not a direct way to connect with the Lord.

I treated the book of Genesis as the most remarkable storybook of all time and Revelation as a sci-fi that I could never understand.

###### **The main reason is I treat His Word like the tree of knowledge (as known as the tree of good and evil).**

Before, I questioned the logical reasoning behind the Bible stories.

For example, I believe itâ€™s pretty unfair for Jacob to get blessed but not Esau. In a logical sense, Esau was not as cunning as Jacob. Jacob lied to get what he wanted, but he was still blessed.

I did not connect with the Lord while reading the story. Instead, I am judging what is good and what is evil. I fell into the spiritual death trap.

However, His Word is the tree of Life (mentioned in Genesis chapter 2). The tree of Life quenches our spiritual thirst, but the tree of good and evil leads to spiritual death.

###### **When we read His Word, let us open our hearts not only to acquire His Wisdom but to connect our spirit to His Spirit.**
