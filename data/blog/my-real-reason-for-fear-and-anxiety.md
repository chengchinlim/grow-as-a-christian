I consistently felt a little anxious for the past few months. I was fearful about my future even though nothing terrible had happened in my life.

###### **I read the Bible and prayed regularly, but I still did not have peace in my heart.**

I could not figure out why it happened, and it got even more intense the day before my birthday.

I am turning 25, but what have I achieved? Did I try hard enough? All the negative thoughts floating in my mind are totally out of control.

I am grateful that I meet with a church brother once a week to study the Word. On that day, I shared my issues with him and asked if he had a solution. He asked me more questions to make sure he gained absolute clarity.

###### **He suddenly pointed out a perfect point, which is why this article exists.**

First, and most importantly, the desire to be entirely independent of the Lord was deeply rooted in my heart.

Second, I was anxious about my future, e.g. job, relationship, and health. It might seem normal to do that, which is pretty accurate since many people did it unknowingly.

###### **As Christians, we know that we are sinful.**

I realized I was worried all this time because I wanted to path my destiny and did not even think about what the Lord wanted. Even though I pray and read His Word, I did not submit my life to Him. He had a plan for me, but I did not bother and only wanted my way.

###### **After I understood my root problem and prayed about it, I felt peace in my heart.**

It is impossible to remove anxiety from my life. Nevertheless, I do not feel anxious regularly. From now on, I will slow down and think again when I start getting worried.

Am I feeling fearful because I want to fully take control of my life and not allow the Lord to be the captain of my ship?

#### **When the storm comes, I hope everyone does not forget who is the real captain of their ships.**
